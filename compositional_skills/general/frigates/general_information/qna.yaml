 - question: How many frigates has Navantia developed in the last years?
   answer: |
     In the last 20 years Navantia has successfully developed 5 programs, including the current F-110 program for Spain, with a total of 17 ships.
 - question: What is a digital twin?
   answer: |
     A virtual replica of the ship that constantly receives information from the vessel.
 - question: What is the F-110 frigate?
   answer: |
     The F-110 is a multipurpose battleship that represents a substantial step forward towards the Smart Ship concept. The vessel integrates the best of industry 4.0 technologies, that will improve her construction, operation and life cycle management.
 - question: What are the technologies that the F-110 integrates?
   answer: |
     The design of this new frigate includes advanced technological features, such as an integrated mast with different sensor and antenna solutions, a multi-mission space that expands the ship\'s capabilities in all defence segments and a new, more efficient and silent hybrid propulsion plant, providing the ship with great versatility.
 - question: What is the integrated services system (ISS)?
   answer: |
     The Integrated Services System (ISS) is an initiative in collaboration with the Universities of Vigo and Coruna to develop an architecture based on the ship\'s 2,000 light points, a neural network that provides a significant reduction in the ship\'s wiring volume, while supporting the incorporation of the 4.0 technologies.
 - question: How many jobs will the F-110 create?
   answer: |
     The F110 program will generate around 9,000 jobs between Navantia\'s own workforce and auxiliary direct employment, with further indirect jobs.
 - question: What services does Navantia provide to the Norwegian Logistics Agency for Defense?
   answer: |
     Maintenance and development of the IPMS (Integrated Platform Management System) new features
     Performance of obsolescence reports about Systems and their components
     Spare parts supply and element repair
     Technical assistance for scheduled maintenance tasks, especially in propulsion systems
     Design and on-site implementation of new functionalities
     Management of design databases
